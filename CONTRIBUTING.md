We are currently in transitionary period. Follow https://github.com/TurboWarp/scratch-gui/issues/633 for updates.

We are open to accepting new extensions. Exact guidelines to be determined later. The bar for an extension to be added here isn't particuarly high.

Updates to existing extensions are also accepted as long as they don't break compatibility with projects already using the extension.

More detailed guidelines will be figured out later.
