# Submitting extensions

This is still very experimental, everything is subject to change.

If you want to add an extension, submit a PR that modifies index.html. If your extension already has a URL, you can use that. If it doesn't you can copy the extension into this repository (copy what already exists).

Expectations:

 - Extensions must reasonably respect user privacy, resources, etc. Just don't be mining cryptocurrency or selling user information to the highest bidder.
 - Backwards compatibility is a requirement.
 - We don't want multiple extensions that do the exact same thing.
